# v0.9.0

Early beta preview of what will be our 1.0.0 release API. This is a major breaking change from the previous version of the SDK with a cleaner API surface and some nice new feature improvements from early feedback.

# v0.5.1

## New Features:

- Added a `commit_fee` field to the channel object to get the amount to be paid in fees for the current set of commitment transactions.

# v0.5.0

Several breaking changes and improvements to the SDK to make it more robust and easier to use.

## Breaking Changes:

- `Edge` objects' entites have been collapsed into `Connection` objects to remove the need for the client to manaually pull out entities from the `edges` field.

  **Before:**

  ```python
  for edge in account.get_transactions().edges:
      print(edge.entity.amount)
  ```

  **After:**

  ```python
  for transaction in account.get_transactions().entities:
      print(transaction.amount)
  ```

- Removed several queries and types which are not needed in the 3P SDK and shouldn't have been exposed. If you were using any of these, please let us know!

## New Features:

- `LightsparkClient.fund_node` to automatically add fake funds to a REGTEST node.
- `LightsparkClient.create_api_token` and `LightsparkClient.delete_api_token` to create and delete API tokens.
- `LightsparkClient.send_payment` to send a keysend payment using a destination node's public key which doesn't require an invoice at all.

## Notable fixes:

- Adding a `__FUTURE_VALUE__` value to all enum classes. This allows the SDK to be forward-compatible with new values that may be added to the API in the future, rather than crashing.

# v0.4.3

- Fix instantiation of enums (they were instantiated as `str` objects)
- Return concrete entities instead of interfaces. This fixes the fact that `Account.get_transactions` did not return all the transactions details.
  - Spread fragments on GraphQL interfaces to enable fetching the details of each entity.
  - Conditional JSON loaders to instantiate the right concrete object.
- Add `__init__.py` files for better module support.
- Add `setup.py` for PIP repository support.

# v0.4.2

- Adds a way to paginate transactions (and other connections) using `after`.
- Updates the SDK to match the latest API version (some fields were added, no breaking change)

# v0.4.1

- Fix 2 bugs around `datetime` serialization:
  - Add the serialization to the JSON encoder
  - Make sure the `datetime` objects are timezone aware

# v0.4.0

- Fields that take arguments are now fetched lazily and expose a function for the client to specify the arguments. Impacts the following fields:
  - `Account.blockchain_balance`
  - `Account.conductivity`
  - `Account.local_balance`
  - `Account.remote_balance`
  - `Account.uptime_percentage`
  - `Channel.uptime_percentage`

```python
# Old way to query (example)
account.blockchain_balance

# New way to query (examples)
account.get_blockchain_balance()
account.get_blockchain_balance(bitcoin_networks=[lightspark.BitcoinNetwork.REGTEST])
```

# v0.3.0

- Eagerly fetch `InvoiceData.destination`

# v0.2.0

SDK and APIs completely refactored. Consider this a new version

# v0.1.0

First draft of the SDK.
